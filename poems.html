      <h2 class="poem-title">A MESSAGE TO THAT ONLY MOTHER</h2>
      <p class="poem-body">
<I>The day glitters, the birds sing and flop their wings to the tune of the day
Just as it was when motherhood was bestowed on you
The day is filled with your unflinching love
You're the very best of all in my life

You're the dawning day twilight that brings confidence on the colorful flowers
The salvaging dew in the period of dryness
The oasis that nurtured the many lives in the wilderness
The umbrella that houses during ceaseless downpours
You're indeed the lonely star that keeps me in light when darkness overarches me
You're the lighted candle that brightens my view of the world
Really, you're the cause to the world being
Your love is always suit generis 
One of a kind that makes you more than just a mother 
 
The more eulogies rained on your uniqueness motherhood
The more I think you deserve just more than that

You're really the very best of all that I ever had in my life
No amount of words can best quantify my euphoria for being cuddled all this while in such a loving care of a loved mother.
Mum, you truly are the woman of my world, so exceptional.
I can't do any much to show my appreciation but to say a GLORIOUS MOTHERS DAY.</I>

<I>The pauper hopes
The affluent does
To the former
Happiness is he to hope
Hope ignites a smile of content

Tattered are his cloths
Sieved as his roof
Place him as a pillar in ceaseless downpours
But he hopes

Strenuous works he does
His hands are callous
This grooms his hope
Depression his foundation is laid
Loneliness he faces his predicaments
Yes, he's optimistic

He lies gazing at the lonely star through the thatched roof
He yawns with tears swell in his eyelids
Streams they gash to his ears
Yet hope glamour him
In a quagmire of poverty, he still trounced despair
Yes, hope is HE.</I>

      <p class="poem-body">
<I>In a much sterilized dream land, lies the fate of my dreams
So paled and stunted
Waiting for the least nourishment to sprout
How can I dream
When my dream land is not worth an incubator
When I dream in folds to no hatching
My dream land is such arid 

How can I dream...
When the dreams are folded in layers, compacted and cemented
When the results from dreaming isn't forthcoming

How can I dream in a dreamless dream?
A dream groomed in a much arid and sterilized dream land
A dream that gives no future hope
A dream that can't be dreamt 
How can I dream....</I>

      <p class="poem-body">
<I>The 21st century ladies
Life seems never to be fading
Deeds they live not to resort to
Wittingly they try to depict the poor innocent petal

Laced from hair to toe
There they "jump" onto the street
The chameleon I supposed walks faster
The real them they've recreated from the "fake"

I suppose they're a little more to "road signs"
They sparkle in day than heavenly bodies do in night
You'll doubt whether they're associated with any dirt

Just follow them to their routes
There their real self is showcased
How much pretense can you express when you're legislated?
Enough of your pretense
We want the real you.</I>

      <p class="poem-body">
<I>He yawns in chains
His stomach squabbles
His mind searches his fortunes of tomorrow
There undertakes him a nap
Dream envelopes him in his woven mat

Slumber lavishes on him eternal glories 
Loyalties embrace him in all flanks
He sips the taste of sub celestial glory

When riches are talked of
His name is ubiquitous
He lives in beatitude, he thinks
Dream denies him of reality 
Who will tap him to be his adversary?

Torrential rain ebbs water into his ghetto
He still cradles to his imagery
He coils his body in cold
Unfortunately, he dawns to reality
Sulky he was in distress.

<I>You saints of the earth
Parading in churches like vultures in attendance to devour carcass
Taken self-composure like a newly born baby that knows never a sin

Their melodious voices echoing in the air like trumpet blown from the heavens
Cradle to their holy books with their faces beaming with delight
Oh you deceitful worshippers
With their inner world so dark a dungeon 
Nursing the devil in will and in spirit

Oh you earthly saints of the earth
Outwardly exalting the creator but nurturing the protagonist in heart
Heartless as that stony heart
Breeding the works of the world's possessor
Pleasing the earthly body

Oh ye saints of the earth
Your deeds are measured not by your will
Not by your appearance
Not by your physical works
When your time is dawned, there
Your creator decides your fate.

      <p class="poem-body">
<I>The innate bane of the poor
That roars within
Devouring any attempt of his company
That never sees the prospers
That never ignites initiative

My memory is really stifled. 
When they steal a glance at the rich, how often they mentally assume them
Thinking they might be lucky
Faultily accused them of bloody riches
Been suspicious of one another for their status quo

What about that innate bane? 
That quenches the little of every wet
My memory seems blank
The proverbial animal lives to be learnt 
There isn't any plethora of wealth to dream to reality 
Is all about the trembling hands been supportive to form a mighty.

<I>he supposed darkness is on extinction 
Never to be resurfaced
The dawning sun has risen to its altitude 
Never a thing to resort to in the days gone past 

The saintly period has dawned
Where deeds are never categorized 
The saintly period where putting on tattered clothes is modern fashion
Where the valuables of mankind are gazetted Without conscious tagging

The saintly days where the littles are informed than the aged
The dawning days where goodness is but a scarce commodity
The dawning days where good deeds are maimed
The saintly days where morality is entitled "colo"

Oh! Gentle souls of our ancestors
The White man's wind has blown
That glorious moments of yours is soiled 
We live not in your present any longer
Hmmm!!  our heads are bow in shame.

      <p class="poem-body">
<I>How often is the pride of man abused? 
 Is their mental agility at its lax?
But their desire for mundane materials is nothing little

How often are they sway away by the tantalizing tone of the protagonist
They made them seemingly the oasis in the wilderness
Heavens they promise them on earth 

Come what may when their lustful desires are accomplished
And a seed is picked
The seemingly oasis in the wilderness dries up.
And they navigate their flanks for others to quench their thirsts

Now, they are left in mental trauma 
Negative thoughts they are slaves to 
How I wish l had reason beyond the box?  
But just a past

They hustle day and night
Been on the scorching sun
Tasting their salty sweat
Just to feed the undesirable element  
Drains of tears trudge down their bellies days and nights
Yet the protagonist is drawn in slumbers
But the would be victim learn not from the tangle
Hmmm, how long would the pride of man be under mental servitude?

      <p class="poem-body">
<I>Before the dead
It seems much a dream 
But wrapped in reality
I stand with my head so hefty
With my eyes ebb and flow volumes of tears
Rills of gullies they created on my cheeks
With my chest so wet and washed

The sensation of the xylophone (gilee) and the "koore" send shiver through my timid body
It's just a split second and the many world is biding him farewell
 Now he lives in his own little world 
An undetermined world of the living 

My eyes drill out tears the more
Not for the sake of the dead I yell
But the sure journey of the uncertain hereafter
It's just a matter of time

My soul is so wracked and cushioned in distress
Life is so vague
I'm being overarched with darkness amidst the sunshine
Hmmm, life, but when!
Time is only the difference.

      <h2 class="poem-title">MY LITTLE HEART</h2>
      <p class="poem-body">
<I>
My heart can sense the fragrance of love
Solidly rocking in the air here and there
Passionately craving for people to venture into
But my heart is so callous and insensitive to its luring tune 

My heart is really indifferent to the beauty of love
Its doors are tightly shut, giving not a pinch of love to drop
My heart is so fragile, so it precipitates not the fancies of love and nurtures not its roots
The depth of my heart is too shallow for a deepen roots of love to thrive

My heart is so fragile and susceptible to damage
It entertains not the foul games of love
It can't undergo surgery ones teared up and broken
So it trudges cautiously on its grounds
Balancing its way to safety

Love is really a wicked game, played not in the territories of the soft hearted
I have seen many a sweetheart, that turns sour
I have seen many a sweetheart that turns bitter for love
I have seen many gushing out tears for love 
Many are lives that prematurely decayed for love 
Many are the gentle and genuine hearts been betrayed by love
Many are the laughs that go sorrow for love

How then can my little heart loves another when the success story of love is bitter sweet?
My heart isn't a wicked player
Not even my conscience can withstand the foul game of love
Is love really a crime? 
My mind is really bloated

      <p class="poem-body">
<I>
Before me, lies a red carpet of dead hopes
So pale in their brightness, up higher in stairs
But there I got stuck at the base
Massing up scattered traces of forces
That never seems enough to cushion the base
So volatile and inconspicuous it might be
Governed by the greatest impossibilities
It gives me no pinch of doubt
That the air can't be gathered with empty hands

As I walk on my red carpet of dead hopes
Remaining in the lower stairs not to quit
I know the much toil for gathered air will be concretized
Giving an elevation so high to get to the last stair of the red carpet
As many a dead hope are still kept alive
The scattered traces of air can be gathered 
Not just for a moment but series of moments

All that's necessary is an unrelenting step
That's always ready of moving to the next stair with the least of gathered masses
The hopes might be dead, but they're alive in their own glory 
Living in the shackles of limitations
Yes, they're untamed
If I could keep moving, those red carpet of dead hopes lived to relive in their deadness.

<I>
n my art of imagination, there was a reality 
Nurtured under a fertile fantasies
Thriving blossomly in the warmth of care
It's roots firmly ingrained in the depth of trust
Sprouting buds, so glamorous of seeing

The morning and evening dew collected on its foliage, dripples down the ground
Keeping the soil moist and supportive
It grows all in fun and cute as a speckled pup 
Hardly had I noticed there's an iota of doubt in my reality
Flaming heat under the deeply rooted trust

There it stands in its glamour, giving of slowly
Had I known my reality was shining in misery
Gradually, it wanes in the heat of distrust in its beauty
 I try grooming it, but it withered under a much unfavorable weather

In my reality, my art of imagination is all but a deception
I never could envision doubt in my trust of reality
I questioned my conscience but the vagueness leaves me with nothing
I looked up to the sun and my instinct tells me, nothing best of it can stand the test of time in doubt.

Brilliantly sparkling in beauty
Trapping pieces of attention of passersby
Many are votes cast I received on my sparkling petals
My terrain was a radiance of my awesomeness

I was a wander created out of a rare
A reason behind every "wow" 
I was purpled in my petals 
A lily of the valley, no doubt
The rose of my time
Noticeable among the many
I was this and many more that can't be accounted for any longer

In my cuteness, on one unmemorable day
Before the sun rises above the horizon 
I was plucked from my stalk
Before the sun could rise again
The brilliance in my petals went paled 
Waning faster in every moment past
I was not worth my beauty anymore
Here I was dropped, in the middle of the path
Being trampled on by every passing foot
Helplessly, I lie in my woes 
Nobody notice my brilliance anymore
The moments of my grace have been rushed over
I'm waiting for the rains 
For my dry self to decompose
Showing no more me 
There it all ends in a jiffy
No more me as site attraction.

n silence
He sits in his loneliness
Somewhat in his inferiority
But noting the distinct features of every element
With intermittent smiles 
But he gives not a wind of a word

He might be indifferent
But in his unspoken words, he assumes social passions for the victims
You can make imbecility out of him
He defends himself not, though hurt
You can downplay him but within him, he's heightened
He can put you off with his nonchalance
But within, he cares like no other
You can tag him rude, but he's hearty
He can wear many a hurt within, but he bows not to the winds

You can obscure him with your verbosity, yet he keeps his silence
You can doubt his capability, but within him lies an unrelenting persona
In his silence he fights for his greatness in cloudiness
In his willingness, when he opens up...
You'll marvel at his lousiness
He's not of many words
But he's lousy in his own ways.

Among the woods
I take my daily respite
Within the shadows of the reserve
I feel the cuddles of nature
I hear sacred voices 
Whirled among the woods

The serendipity of nature, is in perfection
A perfect deviation from murphy's law; perfect storm
Bringing forth a resounding tidings 
Engulf in the terrain, a soul refresher in default
I can feel the sensation of renewal
As I walk among the woods
My damage self is refilled once more
A respite in the reserve
A remedy to a poisoned soul
That cures without bitterness

All I ever wish, is a respite in the woods
Where nature is in realism 
A conduit of fulfilment
A parlor of natural harmony
The cacophony of nature in purity
Bring forth live in the reserve
A moment among the woods 
Is always a pleasure.

The water flows in purity
The serendipity of nature defines our life in quality
The echoes of nature were melodious
The sun shines in its natural brightness
The moon glows in brilliance

Then,
Every moment is sacrosanct in its glory
But as I grow out of my smallness
The present contradicts the past
I see the fakeness in every creature

When I look into the face of man now
I see a disgusting monster
Created out of the many doings of society
Desecrated in his sacredness

To be among the fittest
You have to be defiled in your sanctity
Nature is not natural anymore
The wind now blows profanity
The waters flow in their impureness 
Mountains are degraded into valleys
Valleys are projected into highlights
The avalanche of profanity has clouded the once sanity
I see no more nature in its reality
Every creature is now a facade of nature.

There he stands motionless in his miserable confusion state
Gawking at everything but seeing nothing
The world is so void and dimensionless
How much freedom have he got?
He is being lost to only imagery
He thinks he was contraindicated with directives
Yes, he guessed his freedom was captured and imprisoned
How could he go about his daily activities without order?
What could he have done without been monitored 
He guesses his freedom was really stifled and handicapped
Denying him of his very ecstasies 
How raged he was to always be guided in his thoughts and actions
How he wished he had grown an adult overnight
To have every bit of a freedom to himself
To always think, do and talk unguided
He could never see this coming anytime soon
But here he stands now
In his unlimited freedom
Feeling the more constrain
The world seems so limitless
But limited in every sense
Where is the freedom he aspired for?
For every bit of the freedom foresaw from afar seems shattered and dissipated into the vast space as he gets closer
He thought life in adulthood is a bed of roses
How he wishes he could zero down to the very childhood he despised.

We're liquid, somewhat of a liquid
Eluding in our shape, form and color
We're not static of an object
We move in glory of whom we're at any moment

Being formless to be determined,
We cease the shape of every circumstance
Perfectly fitting the move go

Come under the sun 
Our sweating bodies sparkle at a distance
With our very selves being steamed under the flames of the sun

Within a twinkle, 
Clouds are gathered loosely
In the rains, our very selves are still in existence
We're cold and frozen like ice
Waiting for the sun rays to warm us up again
There we're, floating in mood swings
But we're determined to live our best

Come over to the wilderness
We're there with our bare foot ingrained in the scorching sand
With our bodies dehydrating
But we're poised to survive

In the terrains of snow
We're coded inside out with ice
Marking survival out of our woes 

Somewhat an illusion
These same faces can be seen in that edifies
Clothed in a classic form
Sitting in front of the books, files or computers

If you noticed these same faces
Don't be take it for a fairy tale
Remember we're formless and variable
We never bow to pressure
And if we ever die, it's somewhat an evolution.

Here comes another day 
A day in sameness of yesterday and tomorrow
The dirges go on as usual

With rags, I wrap my shoulders
I pull up my design like faded and torn shorts
In resemblance of a scarecrow I pick my leafless book

With bare foot I hit the ground
I can see my little footprints behind me
With joy, I trek along the path
Passing through depths
Hasting slowly to see the flowers show off their brilliance in grandeur

When I catch glimpses of them
With admiration I feel the depth of happiness
Our commonness only prevails in our natural right
I'm intrigued with their uniqueness
The only force that keeps me wanting to see tomorrow
To admire them one more time 
In my mystery, I long for tomorrow
To take my capsules of happiness from our difference.

Roses are purple
The dawn and twilight are brightly purplish
A symbolic radiance of beauty
Spreading fragrance of love
Created out of her distinct charisma
She's suit generic: one of kind

Beautifully clothed in a warm hearted charisma
Blossoming in a socially fitted form with Godliness
Touching hearts with the melodies of her tone
Her words can melt a hardened heart
Her vocals, somewhat of a lullaby
That can send the most troubled soul to a sleep
           
The tenderness of her voice, is the pills for a worried soul
Her smiles are more of cuddles
That draw forth smiles on the faces of others
Yes, she's a rose, purpled in her color
Destined to spread her fragrance of love to all
She's a rose, that doesn't wither her beauty
She lives in the awesomeness she's created
With a heart of beauty, somewhat a diamond

A song sung by the very soul that its own ears can't make up
But this song is a lullaby for seeking pleasures of the heart
What a song of its caliber
That the very soul that sings it can't make up the lyrics
Yes, that's the mystical song of the heart

A song that can bring good tidings to the very soul
Same within a flip, is a dirge
A dirge sung with excruciating pain
A dirge sung with barrels of salty tears
Yet the heart can't abort it easily
It's a pleasure song of a pain 
For every rain follows a brighter sun

A song under which the soul's heart seeks refuge
It seems so much a conundrum
But that's the signals the heart only can code

This is song of love
The hearts favorite song 
The song that hardens and softens the muscular walls of the heart
A song beyond the normal digestion
It's call the "mystical song"
Not a single lyric makes normal meaning
But it is the song that tiding is embedded
Call it love or the "the mystical song"üíì

I know how much I have hurt my thoughts
I know how much I have hurt my heart
I know how much I have hurt my soul

My body is wrecked, that's how much I've hurt it
I know just a spoken words can't heal you
Because your heart might be wrecked beyond imagination
But written words are secret reports of the heart
Every single word is a pure bleeding of the heart
Just us the eyes can't lie

But if you still doubt the bleedings of my heart
Ask my pillow
The warm tears of regret that soak it every night
How it suffers from my heavy head of thoughts every night
Yes, my pillow can whisper the true beat of my heart
Because it empathize with the heart
Everytime the stars announce their presence in the sky

In case you just don't trust the bleedings of the heart, my pillow can say it all
Better still
The ceiling can testify
What about the bed?
Just ask it
It will tell you the number of twist and turns it suffers every night
In case you just don't trust the bleedings of the heart....
Take a look onto my eyes
There the truth lies

There are times taking solace in your warm hands wouldn't sweet anymore
There are times your charming eyes wouldn't do the magic
A time your sweet soothing tones won't comfort any longer
Moments your smiles wouldn't return another

That such a long time
When the heart is healed in loneliness
The long awaited sorry might mean nothing
By then, the soul of the heart might've gone
And its pulses won't detect the sound of sorry

There'll be a time...
When doses of care will mean nothing
Because there's nothing in emptiness
For the void in the heart is unimaginable
A void that can't be filled with a sorry
At this point
The gentle cry of the heart,
Is silence in loneliness.

That day, I can still remember
How the flickers of the noon sun were grace with the glitters of love
I can still remember
The soft melody of my heart pulses 
When you tell me those catchy three worded sentence
The dictates of my heart couldn't give me the chance to have a second thought
I could feel the love rhythm of the two yarning hearts

I can still remember the harmless, fullfil and lovely smile on your face when I comfirmed you doubts
From then, we thought we were made for each other
We could notice the bubbles of undiluted affection
The darkest night sky seems the brightest day 
We could notice the purity in everything 
Because my insecurities never seem a problem to you
Neither did I take squam with yours

We were perfect in our flawns 
Not until that cold breeze blows over our once fertile land
Causing dryness to make our fertile land so sterile
There I realized
While I try to live with your flawns
Mine easily put you on the edge 
I should've realized this
But the love I feel we share 
Clouded the truth from my imagination

Now I know you were long gone before then
The sky is now clear, I can see the full view
You left, not even a hug, not even a peck, not even a word
My heart is so void 
You caused me bitter tears you never promised me
My nights seem longer than expected
I can't rest in my thoughts
My heart feels so foolish

But am bouncing back by day
Maybe you may think I lost you
But am sure you lost me too
Or probably, we lost ourselves
If I conquer, I will be the strongest
Thank you for bringing out the strength in me
Thank you for making me a better person for the best person
Whoever that you might also be with
May that person be the best for you
I can still remember these genuine beautiful lies.

I am out for a battle 
A battle of death
I fight to die
Anyway, I will still die not fighting 
I'm not a coward 
Afterwards I died a thousand different deaths
I'm out to fight 
Though I would come out a victim of death
I want to die fighting as a hero
Not to sit and die like the many cowards 
Afterall, in either ways, I would still die

If you see me battling in my battle to death
Never get emotional about me
Life is best lived when you're emotionless and heartless 
So don't cause yourself emotional pains

Let the dirges corus from the very start with joyful mood
It's a battle with one option 
But I will only accept defeat when my breath is battled out of me
There, my lifeless body will lie miserably 
Listening to the melodious dirges with fulfillment 
Then I would lie in my breathless body 
Feeling a real hero defeated 
Then I would know 
I have lived a fulfilling life 
A life that didn't teach me to be a coward and die like one
Then I would commence my makers journey 
Seeking to get favour over my much tortured soul. 

Dear me
I belong to those who're long gone before me
My ways doesn't flow in the current of the lot
How much of myself can I say belongs to me?
It's just like am trying to fit into a flow which I'm meant to stand out
Nothing seems more of my ways
I just feel like a total stranger in my own being. 
How much of myself can I say is real? Am I in the wrong flow?
I think I belong to my ancestors. Because we have things in common 
I feel so isolated and lonely in my deeds
The much occupied world is so viod in my ways
I was born into this world like any other, but am so much lonely 
Here I am, joilted in my difference 
This is just too unfair 
I can't fit in, I can't stand out. I don't know how much of myself is real to me

How can I describe the pain that nurtured me or the sweetness I have never enjoyed?
Yes but that's my life. I just can't be the same
But wait, how many of the world turn to think differently?
Am left out, solo, lost in a vast clear space under the brightness of the sun
So bright the day might be, but I go out with lartern to find myself 
I'm not even within myself 
My dear self, please am sorry
I got lost trying to find others
I trusted when I shouldn't have 
When I was supposed to cry, I faked a smile so that others would worry about me 
When I could break down and quit going, I tried to keep moving on my knees just to motivate others to come along
When I could falsify my being, I played the real me because I thought everybody believes in realism 
I could be like everyone, but I decided to be me
Now the world is against my true self
And am trying to find myself in the crowded lot

Dear me, please I'm sorry
I hurt you so much for being true 
I thought I was born to stand out but the world in its cruelty wants me to fit in
Dear me, you don't belong here, you belonged to the generation that's on extinction 
Am sorry for shattering you
Oh, see how wrecked you're now...
Am sorry for the many hugs that you give out that never returned 
Am sorry for the many cares you give out which you never received back
Am sorry for the many good vibes you ignited which never come back to you
Am sorry for creating a viod in your flesh

Now you're an empty vessel, lost in the thin air
In your quest to find others, you're lost within yourself 
I know you can't be yourself anymore because the world has taken away your purity 
I made you to trust too much 
I made you to believe in the words of a cruel world
I am sorry dear me
You underwent changing phases of what you think is undesirable 
Just not to hurt those that matters to you 
But nobody cares how they were hurting you with their rude behavior 
But here you are, a wretched abandoned boat, swinging to the waves in the depth of an ocean
Now, here you're, jerked in misery 
Nurtured in your pains and buttered in your wounds 
You feel no pain from an overdose of pains
When you took people as your priority, you were treated as an option 
Where you are, wrecked, disposed like any ordinary piece of rag

Dear self, am sorry I took your soul out of you for being a good person 
Am sorry the door is shut on you when when I was busy holding it open for others
Am sorry I held the light to lit up the way for others when you were left out in the darkness 
Dear me, am sorry for killing you prematurely.
